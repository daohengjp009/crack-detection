# System Patterns

## System Architecture
The crack detection system follows a modular architecture with distinct components:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│  Data Pipeline  │────▶│ Image Processing │────▶│  Model Training │────▶│   Inference     │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **PyTorch Framework**: Selected for its flexibility, research-oriented design, and dynamic computational graph
2. **CNN Architecture**: Convolutional Neural Networks are well-suited for image classification tasks
3. **Modular Design**: Separation of concerns between data processing, model definition, training, and inference
4. **Dataset Selection**: Using the Concrete Crack Images dataset from IBM Cognitive Class for training and evaluation

## Design Patterns in Use
1. **Factory Pattern**: For creating different model architectures
2. **Strategy Pattern**: For implementing different data augmentation techniques
3. **Observer Pattern**: For monitoring training progress and visualization
4. **Repository Pattern**: For abstracting data access and storage
5. **Pipeline Pattern**: For the sequential processing of images

## Component Relationships

### Data Module
- Responsible for data loading, preprocessing, and augmentation
- Implements dataset splitting (train/validation/test)
- Handles data normalization and transformations

### Model Module
- Defines neural network architectures
- Implements model initialization and configuration
- Provides interfaces for different model types (ResNet, VGG, custom CNN)

### Training Module
- Manages the training loop and validation
- Implements loss functions and optimization strategies
- Handles checkpointing and model persistence
- Provides metrics and performance monitoring

### Inference Module
- Performs inference on new images
- Handles model loading and prediction
- Provides interfaces for batch or single image processing
- Generates visualization of results

## Technical Principles
1. **Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent results through random seed fixing and version control
2. **Scalability**: Design to handle larger datasets and model architectures
3. **Maintainability**: Well-documented code with clear separation of concerns
4. **Testability**: Comprehensive test suite for critical components
5. **Extensibility**: Easy integration of new models or techniques

This architecture provides a solid foundation for the crack detection system, allowing for iterative improvements and extensions as the project evolves.
