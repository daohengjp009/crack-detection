# Project Brief: Crack Detection using Deep Learning

## Core Requirements
- Develop a deep learning solution for automated crack detection in structural health monitoring
- Implement computer vision and neural networks to classify images (crack vs. no-crack)
- Create a reliable, accurate model for structural integrity assessment

## Project Goals
1. Process and prepare the Concrete Crack Images dataset from IBM Cognitive Class
2. Design and implement neural network models for crack detection
3. Train and evaluate models using appropriate metrics
4. Create a user-friendly interface for analyzing new images
5. Document the approach, methods, and results

## Project Scope
- Focus on binary classification (crack/no-crack)
- Utilize computer vision techniques for image processing
- Implement deep learning models for classification
- Provide evaluation metrics and performance analysis
- Create documentation for setup and usage

## Constraints
- Using Python 3.8+ ecosystem
- Utilizing PyTorch/TensorFlow for model implementation
- Must be able to process standard image formats

## Future Considerations
- Expand to detect crack severity/classification
- Implement real-time detection capabilities
- Integrate with structural monitoring systems
- Add explainability features to highlight detected cracks

This project aims to provide a reliable, automated solution for detecting structural cracks, potentially improving safety monitoring processes and reducing manual inspection efforts.
