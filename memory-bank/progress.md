## Current Status
The project is in the initial setup phase. The repository structure has been created, but implementation of core functionality has not yet begun. The next step is to populate the src/ directory with the necessary Python modules.

## Known Issues
1. **Empty Directories**: Currently, most project directories are empty and need to be populated
2. **Missing Implementation**: Core functionality is not yet implemented
3. **Dataset Availability**: Need to implement dataset download or provide instructions for manual acquisition
4. **Documentation Gaps**: Usage and API documentation are not yet available

## Immediate Action Items
1. Create the basic file structure in the src/ directory
2. Implement dataset download and preprocessing utilities
3. Develop a simple CNN model architecture
4. Create a basic training script

The project is at a very early stage and requires significant development work to implement the planned functionality.
