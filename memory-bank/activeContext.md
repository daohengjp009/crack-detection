# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The project is in its initial setup phase. The repository structure has been created, but most directories are currently empty. The requirements.txt file has been set up with essential dependencies.

## Recent Changes
- Created the basic project structure (src/, data/, models/, tests/, docs/)
- Added README.md with project overview and setup instructions
- Set up requirements.txt with necessary Python dependencies

## Next Steps
1. **Data Acquisition**:
   - Implement script to download the Concrete Crack Images dataset
   - Organize raw data into appropriate directory structure
   - Create data validation utilities

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**:
   - Develop image preprocessing functions
   - Implement data augmentation techniques
   - Create dataset and dataloader classes

3. **Model Development**:
   - Create baseline CNN model architecture
   - Implement model training utilities
   - Set up evaluation metrics and visualization

4. **Project Structure Enhancement**:
   - Complete the src/ directory structure
   - Set up logging and configuration utilities
   - Create initial unit tests

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Model Selection**: Determining whether to implement a custom CNN or utilize a pre-trained architecture (ResNet, VGG, etc.)
2. **Evaluation Metrics**: Selecting appropriate metrics for model performance assessment
3. **Data Augmentation**: Deciding which augmentation techniques are appropriate for crack detection
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Planning approach for optimizing model hyperparameters
5. **Deployment Strategy**: Considering how the model will be deployed for practical use

## Current Challenges
1. **Dataset Exploration**: Need to understand the characteristics of the Concrete Crack Images dataset
2. **Performance Baselines**: Establishing performance benchmarks for model evaluation
3. **Implementation Details**: Finalizing specific implementation choices for each component

The immediate priority is to set up the data pipeline and create a functional baseline model that can be improved iteratively.
